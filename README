Usage of airfi infrastructure:
==============================
1.
when device boots for the first time, create folder in /var/log/ with
right ownership and permissions for logs

/usr/local/bin	=> airfi_log_setup.sh
/etc/system/system => airfi-log-perms.service
systemctl enable airfi-log-perms.service (for enabling and link file creation)

this will run onetime

2.
log dmesg in /var/log/dmesg_logs every 10 minutes from device boot as seperate files
create folder in /var/log/ with right ownership and permissions for logs

/usr/local/bin  => log_dmesg.sh
/etc/system/system => log-dmesg.service
/etc/system/system => log-dmesg.timer (run every 10 min)

systemctl enable --now log-dmesg.timer (for enabling and link file creation)
